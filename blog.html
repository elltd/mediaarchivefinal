				<p>Welcome back to the blog! There’s a lot to catch up on from the past few weeks. It’s been a great time for new media, particularly music. Throughout January there has been new albums from Ethel Cain, Ghais Guevara, Mike, and I’ve found a new favorite in Central Cee’s <em>Cant Rush Greatness</em>, a UK drill album. But something I’ve been looking forward to since I bought the tickets last October is not an album, but rather a live concert. Yesterday, I attended Faye Webster’s Underdressed at the Symphony Tour (with special guest Mei Ehara!) at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. Webster is an Atlanta-based indie singer-songwriter, and Ehara is a Japanese indie-folk-jazz singer. This isn’t the first time I’ve seen Faye, and not even the first time I’ve seen her during this tour, either— I also attended her concert at The Dell Music Center in Philadelphia, PA on Friday, July 26th, 2024. Here, I’m going to tell you how both concerts went, and also about why you should always experience live music whenever you can. Going to her tour the second time was on a whim, as I picked the cheapest tickets I could find, and I still had an amazing time. This was completely opposite of the concert in Philadelphia where I bought first section tickets to be super up close to her performance. Despite the differences, I had a great experience enjoying live music both times!
                    <br><br>
                    The day of February 26th, I woke up to a text message at 8 AM from my friend who I’d bought the ticket for as a birthday gift. Turns out, she was insanely sick and had a high fever, so she would be unable to go later that day. I had to find someone else to give the ticket to and go with as soon as possible, or I’d have wasted it. Fortunately, my friend and fellow PMA contributor Joel was able to step in, as he’d already be in the city and could come after he was out of work. Plus, he was a fan of Faye himself, so it worked out perfectly. I had a late start to the day, so I began to get ready to go to the city.
                    <br><br>
                    I took the NJ Transit train to New York Penn Station. While I could have walked, I decided to take the easier route and entered the subway at 34 St-Penn Station and took the 1 train two stops to 50 St, and walked a few minutes to Radio City Music Hall. On the way, I began to see people that definitely looked like they were headed the same place as I was. Dozens of young teenagers or college aged adults in baggy clothing, with an alternative/indie look to them. Sure enough, as I walked up towards 6th Ave, the queue wrapped around the corner of the block as we joined the masses. My friend was waiting towards the end of the line as there was no rush to get in due to the ticketed seating- no need to make a break for the closest view from the pit, as I’ve had to do at shows at smaller venues. 
                    <br><br>
                    When we entered, it seemed like chaos, but I quickly found the merch line. While Faye Webster was headlining, Mei Ehara was an artist I also enjoyed, and the only thing I bought that night was a vinyl of her 2020 album <em>Ampersands</em>. We climbed the steps to the fourth floor as our tickets were the furthest section away from the stage, all the way up on the third mezzanine floor. Despite the distance, we still had a good overhead view of the stage. I wasn’t overly concerned with not seeing the exact details of the stage as not only had I already seen Faye up close, but the way her performance echoed throughout the building was impactful in itself. The way her songs like “Jonny,” “Lifetime,” and the opener “But Not Kiss,” swelled clearly made the crowd emotional, and I definitely felt it as well. I believe the instrumentation of some of the songs differed from the studio album recording, with some of the songs sounding more sparse or classical, which only amplified the sorrowful lyrics. There were laughs too— the opening seconds of her tour features a minion from the <em>Despicable Me</em> animation series dressed as her and warbling in minion-speak popping up on the background screen as she makes her entrance. At the end of the show, her partner Deb Never, a LA-based alt-pop singer-songwriter, came out on the stage to hug her, closing the show on a sweet and loving note. It was a wonderful night in the city with a beautiful performance, and the ticket cost was pretty low, making it a satisfying experience even when we could barely make out the figures onstage.
                    <br><br>
                    My time at the Philadelphia leg of her tour was a little bit more chaotic. In a bit of ironic luck, a different friend that was coming along with me at the time also fell sick the day of the concert, but decided to come and tough it out, as they chalked it up to allergies. Unfortunately they only felt worse throughout the day, but it didn’t impact my concert going experience until the very end of the show.
                    <br><br>
                    The concert was near the end of July, so at this point in the summer my friend and I had already begun moving into our off-campus house in New Brunswick. We were both in the area to meet up and go to the concert together. As I’d paid for the tickets, my friend decided to drive to Philadelphia in return. We were in the section closest to the stage, only nine rows back, meaning the tickets had been pretty pricey. Soon enough, we got into the car and were off towards Pennsylvania.
                    <br><br>
                    The drive there was pretty smooth and we didn’t run into any major traffic. Once we got to the venue, we were excited to discover that parking was free, a rarity when it comes to concerts and big events. The Dell Music Center is an outdoor amphitheater, so in retrospect the environment and vibe of my first Faye Webster concert to the other were like night and day. The crowd seemed to be much younger as well. We arrived there pretty early, so we had time to get snacks and wait in line to buy merchandise. Both of us purchased an <em>Underdressed at the Symphony</em> cassette tape for $10, and I also bought a vinyl of the same album, which was a special edition clear and blue pressing.
                    <br><br>
                    The special guest for this performance was Julie, a shoegaze band from Los Angeles, although we didn’t catch much of their performance. Faye came on just as the sky was beginning to dim, sunset soon on the way. I was immediately enraptured by her, our proximity to the stage really allowing me to take in the set design. Faye was dressed in a full denim blue outfit, surrounded by laundry machines, which spun and glowed throughout the the show. The backstage screen was the outline of a t-shirt on a hanger, playing further into the laundromat theme of the album and tour. The show was full of whimsy, featuring the Faye minion and video game graphics during her song “Lego Ring.” The background lighting slowly morphed from various shades of blue to pink, red, and purple. When the stage was glowing yellow, bubbles began to flow out from the stage towards us in the crowd during her emotional performance of “But Not Kiss,” creating a stunning visual of Faye and the band amongst the lights reflecting off the floating orbs. Fans sat in ticketed seats and some laid on blankets on a grass field, making the outdoor, breezy environment feel cozy as we watched a performance under the stars, many in the crowd singing along to her lyrics. Soon enough, we reached the end of the show, although we had to leave during the encore as my friend was finally feeling the brunt of their sickness. Thankfully, we beat the traffic as a result, and I was grateful to arrive and leave Philadelphia with no major issues.
                    <br><br>
                    As a music lover, going to concerts is always an exciting time for me. It’s one thing to put on a CD or play a song off Spotify, but nothing will beat the feeling of witnessing music being performed right in front of you. Seeing Faye in Philadelphia cost me $100 dollars, and I had a great time. Seeing her again in New York City cost me $30, and I had an equally great time. Every single performance is a unique experience— if you have a chance, no matter the quality of the ticket, go see your favorite artists live!
